                Good question! I think what I am drawn to most is the opportunity to incorporate problem-solving into my daily routine. I enjoy the intellectual challenge of learning how to code in different languages and building on first principles to approach problems with both logic and creativity. So far, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript has been entertaining and gratifying and I have felt the same from other languages I have utilised in the past.</p> 
<ul class ="answers">
<li>At university I studied Biology and was taught how to use R and Excel throughout my 
    course for the analytics and visualisation of experimental data. </li>
<li>After graduation I completed a Machine Learning bootcamp on the fundamentals of python. 
    We were taught how to handle a number of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and 
    Matplotlib and the fundamentals of linear regression, multilinear regression, logistic regression, 
    decision trees and random forest. </li>
<li>Last year I studied a course on Data Analytics from OpenClassrooms which covered python 
    further from a business perspective. I also learnt how to query a relational database with 
    SQL using cross-table queries and create tables with referential integrity
      and primary key constraints. Finally, we were also taught how to collate and interpret 
      qualitative and quantative data using Tableau to create data visualisations. 
      These were based on the business needs of a customer and my viz was a dynamic 
      dashboard that could support changing KPI targets.</li>

</ul>

All of these opportunities to learn new skills and techniques has been deeply satisfying. I am someone who enjoys the process of learning and I’m attracted to the need to constantly adapt and progress in the field of technology.

                Well, first of all the bootcamp itself is an incredible opportunity. I think the way in which it is taught through projects reflects how tasks would actually be assigned in a real-life setting. The projects appear to leave room for creativity and interpretation and encourage problem-solving rather than simple question-answering. It would be wonderful to have a portfolio that pushed me to develop genuine aptitude and not just copy and paste templates. </p>

                <p class = "answers">I’m also deeply impressed by the roots of Founders and Coders and its dedication to support just causes. I believe that I share the vision of the organisation and want my career to have a similar positive social impact.</p>

                <p class = "answers">I am applying for the Hackney apprenticeship and have witnessed first-hand how important the council is in our community. Our household was affected by the cyber-attack which resulted in a plethora of confusion and budgeting difficulties around our council-tax bill. The situation showed just how vital the councils services are, and in a community as diverse as Hackney it is essential that these services can be accessed in the simplest and most dependable way. My aim is to join the council and work towards delivering local public services that support the community and centre around understanding users as the basis for informed improvements.</p>

                    I completed a course funded by the DoE last September but have been told to apply anyway 
                    as the course straddles the financial year. That decision I leave to you!
